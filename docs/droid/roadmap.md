## Roadmap

Currently we only support the Iqama Source used by the Administration of Khaled Ben Walid [https://iqama.ccil-kbw.com](https://iqama.ccil-kbw.com) but we should make this app agnostic of the User's choices.

### Iqama Sources

Integrate multiple Iqama sources (Many Majids have their own CSV files for Iqama or use popular tools from the App Store etc, we should be flexible to integrate any Iqama source)

### Deployment

Improve deployments on all Applications (Something as easy as: `curl https://raw.github.com/robot/install.sh | bash`, with auto-detect of operating system)

### Auto-Updater
Integrate automatic updates (with user's approval while displaying diff of `CHANGELOG`)
