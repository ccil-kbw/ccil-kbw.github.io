# Masjid's Droid Documentation

This page serves as a centralized place to document all tools developed by the Khaled Ben Walid team.

For more information please visit [github organisation](https://github.com/ccil-kbw)

Our IT organization does its best to keep all development as transparent as possible. Our main focus is the privacy and the security of our users. All code can be copied and used but can't be sold commercially.

Masjid's Droid was original written by [@serafdev](https://twitter.com/serafdev) to serve the needs of the beloved community of [Khaled Ben Walid](https://ccil-kbw.com) but is intended to benefit the whole beloved Ummah, East to West.
