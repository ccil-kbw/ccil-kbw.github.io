_This is an outdated documentation of the Website, we have migrated to Wordpress, more to come._

## Introduction

Our Masjid's Website is Open Source and is a Fork of the [Chirpy Jekyll theme](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy#readme), it is currently deployed on GitHub Pages to have free hosting, but overall it's simply a Frontend Static page so can be deployed anywhere.

## Codebase

The Website's codebase can be found here: [https://github.com/ccil-kbw/website](https://github.com/ccil-kbw/website)

## Reporting Issues and Contributions

If you find any issues or would like to contribute with anything feel free to open an Issue here and we can start the discussion from there: [https://github.com/ccil-kbw/website/issues](https://github.com/ccil-kbw/website/issues)

## Roadmap

- Replace the pages Comment section that uses GitHub Discussions with a self-hosted tool (with Google or other SSO integrations)
- Add a Live-Chat to have our Users interact with the Administration
- Add a Form builder (similar to hubspot, ideally something we can also deploy ourselves - but we can start with an external tool, no problem)
